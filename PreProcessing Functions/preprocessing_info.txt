For the preprocessing of the EEG data, the following approaches were employed:

- Standard MATLAB functions for core signal processing operations, including bandpass filtering, notch filtering, and related preprocessing steps.

- Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) to address transient and non-stationary artifacts; this method is provided as an embedded submodule within the corresponding GitHub subfolder.

- FORCe for advanced artifact handling and signal enhancement, with the implementation available at: https://www.tugraz.at/fileadmin/user_upload/Institute/INE/Software/FORCe.zip
